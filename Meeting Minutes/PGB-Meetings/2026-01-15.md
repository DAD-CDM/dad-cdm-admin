## Meeting Notes

* **Taking Inventory**  
  * The meeting focused on attendance issues and Storyzy’s non-renewal. Claudia mentioned that Anaïs is interested in getting involved with the TSC.   
  * The PGB discussed reducing their meeting frequency to every two months to allow for denser agendas and better preparation time, but did not take a decision. They identified a need to increase attendance and engage with more people, as well as to recruit additional PGB and TSC members to address gaps.  
* **PGB Goal Setting and Recruitment**  
  * The group discussed goal setting for the PGB, with Mark identifying recruiting more TSC members as the top priority. Max outlined three key areas: recruiting and retaining PGB members, recruiting new TSC members, and increasing public outreach. Danielle mentioned previous conference submissions were difficult because the program committees of the chosen event were very selective. She suggested targeting more accessible events like FIRST and professional associations for regular outreach.   
* **CoSAI Collaboration Discussion**	  
  * Danielle discussed potential collaboration with CoSAI, a OASIS project focused on AI security and cyber threats. Danielle suggested that their work could complement CoSAI’s efforts, particularly in areas like threat data sharing and global AI model frameworks. Claudia pointed to CoSAI’s ambitious schedule and voiced concerns regarding a match between the two projects but agreed to investigate further possibilities for collaboration.  
* **Project Value and Awareness Strategies**  
  * Danielle emphasized the importance of publishing and conference presence to boost brand awareness, while Max noted the need to follow up about modeling a fintech use case.   
  * The group discussed the value proposition for organizations to participate in their project, with Veronica expressing a need for more resources and clear engagement opportunities to feel more connected. Max suggested focusing on both organizational benefits like PR and liability protection, as well as individual value such as networking and community building, to attract and retain sponsors. The discussion concluded with an agreement to prioritize creating more content and emphasizing the project's use cases to increase engagement, particularly given the current challenges in attracting and retaining participants.  
  * Claudia highlighted the challenges of managing collaborative work, noting that successful projects require dedicated facilitators who can manage tasks and ensure coherent progress.   
  * Danielle offered the help of a colleague for reviewing documentation, while expressing a desire to maintain current PGB sponsors. The team agreed to focus on mapping the threat actor framework with real-world use cases and to finalize review processes for documentation.  
  * The team discussed content strategy and resource constraints. Danielle and Max agreed to focus on creating AI and threat intelligence sharing content in February, with Danielle working on blog posts with Veronica about ad tech use cases. Max acknowledged his limited capacity but committed to exploring additional resources, including potential interns and volunteers, to help with content creation and outreach. The team also discussed the need to model specific threats and connect with potential sponsors, particularly in the fintech and banking sectors.

## Action Items

* Claudia: Onboard Anaïs to the TSC  
* Danielle: Reach out to Margo and Rosalie to discuss TSC engagement, progress, and the need for increased output to support PGB sponsor retention.  
* Danielle: Collaborate with Veronica in February to create content (e.g., blog post) focused on AdTech use cases, especially around AI, fraud, or threat sharing, for publication by end of February.  
* Max: Reach out to potential contributors (e.g., recent grads, volunteers) to model threat intelligence use cases and/or write related content, and encourage their involvement in the project.  
* Max: Attempt to identify and engage additional resources from FDD or other contacts for content creation or project support.
